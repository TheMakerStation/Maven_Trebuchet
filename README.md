## Assembly Notes

1. Use a .5" threaded rod with washers and bolts to assemble the arm.
2. It helps to cut a small piece of pvc and put in between the rod and the wood to reduce friction.
3. Sling should be 36" long and bend the launch pin (aka nail) to about 50 degrees.
4. For weights, get a 2.5-gallon bucket and load it with heavy things. Around 15-20 pounds seems to work pretty well.
